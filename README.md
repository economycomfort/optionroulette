# optionroulette

I never quite finished this, but provides a standalone python script and a python script which can be run as a Google Cloud Function (or likely Lambda or Azure Function with minor modification).

Outputs a valid option contract for a provided input ticker.  Idea is to eventually have it randomly pull a ticker (with a valid options chain) from the S&P500 or Nasdaq.

Never got around to the randomization part.
